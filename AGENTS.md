# AGENTS.md: external-dns-unifi-webhook

Guidance for AI coding agents (and humans) writing Go in this repository. These are
the home-operations fleet's shared Go conventions, kept in sync word-for-word
across every Go service/CLI in the org; propagate any change here to the
others.

## Working in this repo: AI usage, commits, and safety

This repo doesn't carry its own `CONTRIBUTING.md`; GitHub serves the org-wide
one from [`home-operations/.github`](https://github.com/home-operations/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md),
which includes an AI Usage Policy that applies to Claude Code here the same
as any other AI tool: assistive use only, a human must author the majority
of any change, AI use must be disclosed, a human reviews every line before
submission, and the contributor must be able to explain any line a reviewer
asks about. AI must never write the PR description, an issue, or a reply to
a human on the contributor's behalf. Read the policy itself rather than
trusting this summary; it can change without this file being updated to
match.

- PR titles follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):
  `<type>[(scope)][!]: <description>` (e.g. `fix(config): reject a negative
timeout`), which is what drives release-please's version bumps. Individual
  commit messages don't have to follow the format, though matching it is
  fine. Sign off commits: `git commit -s`.
- Never `git commit`, `git push`, or open a PR unless asked to. Ask before
  any destructive or hard-to-reverse action (force-push, `git reset --hard`,
  deleting a branch, rewriting history) instead of defaulting to it.
- Never touch secrets or gitignored files (`*.key`, `*.crt`, `.env`,
  anything `.gitignore` matches). This fleet passes signing keys and
  webhook secrets by path or env var specifically so they're never
  committed; don't be the exception.
- Don't state a library's API, flags, or defaults from memory: verify
  against `pkg.go.dev`, the vendored source in the module cache, or this
  project's own code. This fleet's dependencies (`caarlos0/env`,
  `spf13/pflag`, `k8s.io/client-go`, and friends) change behavior between
  major versions in ways that are easy to get subtly wrong from
  recollection alone.
- After a change, run `mise run test` and `mise run lint` (and `mise run
generate-check` where it exists) before calling it done. Don't claim
  untested code works.

## Baseline

- **Idiomatic.** Follow [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) and
  the [Code Review Comments](https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments) wiki.
  `gofmt -s` runs on every staged `.go` file via lefthook and again in CI:
  never hand-format, and don't fight it with inline exceptions. Comments
  explain non-obvious constraints only (a hidden invariant, why a workaround
  exists, what would surprise a reader); don't narrate what good naming
  already says, and don't reference the current change or past behavior in
  a comment: that belongs in the PR description and rots as the code moves
  on.
- **Go 1.26**, matching `.mise/config.toml`'s `tools.go` and the `go`
  directive in `go.mod`; bump both together, never one without the other.
  When a newer construct is genuinely more idiomatic, use it: Go 1.26 added
  `errors.AsType[T](err)`, a generic type-safe replacement for the
  `var t *T; errors.As(err, &t)` two-step; prefer it in new code. `go fix`
  (rebuilt in 1.26 as a modernizer runner on `go vet`'s analysis) surfaces
  these mechanical migrations; run it after a toolchain bump.
- **Idempotent.** Reconcilers, code generators (`mise run generate`), and CLI
  subcommands must be safe to re-run: identical input yields identical
  output/state, with no accumulating side effects on a second invocation.
  `ocharted` is the clearest fleet example: every cache entry is
  re-derivable from upstream, so a restart or an extra replica never
  affects correctness, only latency.
- **DRY and minimal, without premature abstraction.** Three similar call
  sites are fine as-is; don't introduce an interface, options struct, or
  generic helper until a real third caller needs the variance it buys.
  Touch only what the task requires: don't refactor or "improve" adjacent
  code, and match the existing style even where you'd do it differently.
  Remove imports, variables, and functions your own change orphaned; leave
  pre-existing dead code alone and mention it instead of deleting it
  unprompted.
- **Unit tested**, table-driven via `t.Run` subtests. Stdlib `testing` is the
  default and is sufficient for most of this fleet's tests (config parsing,
  HTTP handlers, pure functions); reach for `testify` (`assert`/`require`)
  when a table's per-case assertions get repetitive. `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime`
  operators keep the kubebuilder scaffold's Ginkgo/Gomega suite rather than
  mixing in a second framework. `go test -race` is the floor (`mise run
test`); don't submit goroutine-touching code you haven't run under `-race`.
- **`log/slog`**, JSON handler to stdout by default (a text-format escape
  hatch via config is fine for local runs), never a third-party logging
  library. Call `slog.SetDefault` once in `main`, then use package-level
  `slog.Info`/`slog.Error`/etc., or thread a `*slog.Logger` through
  constructors that are genuinely reused outside `main`; don't pass a
  logger through call chains that don't need one.
- **`github.com/caarlos0/env/v11`** for configuration: one `Config` struct in
  `internal/config`, populated by `env.Parse`/`env.ParseAs`, behind a `Load()`
  that also derives any computed fields and validates: fail fast on invalid
  config at startup instead of letting a bad value surface later as a
  runtime error. Doc-comment every field with what it does and why its
  `envDefault` is what it is; the struct doubles as the config reference.
- **`github.com/spf13/pflag`, only when the app has a real CLI surface**:
  subcommands, flags a human types, anything beyond "read env vars and
  serve." Wire it through `github.com/spf13/cobra` rather than a bare
  `pflag.FlagSet` (see `chaski`, `flate`, `ocharted`). A service that's
  entirely env-configured shouldn't take a flags dependency just to have one.
  Exception: `controller-runtime` operators keep the kubebuilder scaffold's
  stdlib `flag` + `opts.BindFlags(flag.CommandLine)` wiring; don't convert
  generated operator boilerplate to pflag.

## Project layout

`cmd/<app>/main.go` is the entrypoint; everything else lives under
`internal/` unless another repo needs to import it as a library
(`github.com/home-operations/flate` is imported directly by `downflate` and
`konflate`, which is why it isn't under `internal/`). Keep `main.go` to
wiring: parse config, build the logger, construct dependencies, run,
translate the top-level error into an exit code. Business logic belongs in
`internal/<package>`, not in `main`.

## Errors

Wrap with `fmt.Errorf("<component>: %w", err)` so a caller gets context
without losing the original error for `errors.Is`/`errors.As`/`errors.AsType`.
The `"config: %w"`-style prefix used throughout this fleet is deliberate:
grep an error message and you know which package raised it. Define sentinel
errors (`errors.New`, package-level `Err*`) for conditions a caller branches
on, and classify with a single `errors.Is` switch at the boundary that turns
an internal error into an HTTP status / exit code / CR condition, rather than
scattering classification through business logic. Never discard an error
silently: `_ = someCall()` is only for genuinely fire-and-forget calls (e.g.
best-effort metrics), and say why in a comment when that's not obvious.

## Context & shutdown

Every function that does I/O takes a `context.Context` as its first
parameter. Long-running processes derive their root context from
`signal.NotifyContext(context.Background(), syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM)`
and re-arm the default handler on a second signal so a stuck drain can still
be force-killed. Prefer `golang.org/x/sync/errgroup` over raw
`sync.WaitGroup` + channels when fanning out goroutines that can fail: it
propagates the first error and cancels the group's context for you.

## Build, lint, test (via mise)

Mise is mandatory: it pins the exact Go and golangci-lint versions
(`.mise/config.toml`), so running `go build`/`go test` outside `mise run`
risks a toolchain mismatch with CI. `mise tasks` lists everything available
in this repo; the common ones every fleet Go repo has:

```bash
mise run build      # go build ./...
mise run fmt         # go fmt ./...
mise run vet         # go vet ./...
mise run test        # go test -race ./... -coverprofile cover.out
mise run lint        # golangci-lint run
mise run lint-fix    # golangci-lint run --fix
```

Repo-specific tasks (`generate`, `generate-check`, `test-integration`,
`test-e2e`, `bench`, `helm-*`, ...) show up in `mise tasks` too; check
before adding one that might already exist under a different name.

`lefthook` (`.lefthook.toml`, extending the shared `home-operations/.github`
config) runs `gofmt -s -w` on staged `.go` files pre-commit. CI additionally
fails on `go mod tidy` producing a diff and on stale generated files
(`generate-check`); run both locally before pushing. Lint rules live in
`.golangci.yml`; read it instead of trusting a restated list here, since the
two can drift.

## Containers

Static binaries by default: `CGO_ENABLED=0`, `-trimpath`, `-ldflags "-s -w -X
main.version=... -X main.commit=..."`, built `FROM golang:<pinned>-alpine`
and run `FROM gcr.io/distroless/static:nonroot` (see `ocharted/Dockerfile`
for a reference implementation). Only drop `CGO_ENABLED=0` if a dependency
genuinely requires cgo; that's the exception, and it should be justified in
a comment. Long-running services in containers should set `GOMEMLIMIT` via
`github.com/KimMachineGun/automemlimit` so the GC reclaims before the cgroup
OOM-kills the process (see `chaski`, `echo`, `konflate`, `ocharted`); expose
Prometheus metrics via `github.com/prometheus/client_golang` on a separate
port from the main listener.

## Security

`govulncheck ./...` (`go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest`)
isn't wired into CI anywhere in the fleet yet. Run it before cutting a
release regardless, and consider proposing it as a `mise run` task / CI job
here.
