[ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) is a Kubernetes add-on for automatically managing DNS records for Kubernetes ingresses and services by using different DNS providers. This webhook provider allows you to automate DNS records from your Kubernetes clusters into your UniFi Network controller.

## üéØ Requirements

- ExternalDNS >= v0.14.0
- UniFi OS >= 3.x
- UniFi Network >= 8.2.93

## üö´ Limitations

*UniFi uses [dnsmasq](https://dnsmasq.org) as the backend of it's dns resolver and dhcp server.*
*This project is subject to the limitations of dnsmasq. Please report any issues you encounter utilizing this provider.*

- Wildcard and Duplicate CNAME Records are not supported by UniFi.
    - *.example.com 0 IN CNAME internal.example.com
    - deployment.example.com 0 IN CNAME external.example.com internal.example.com

## ‚õµ Deployment

### Gathering your credentials

The DNS Webhook provider supports 2 styles of authenticating to UniFi

* API Token under a specific user
* Username and Password of specific user

<br>

1. Open your UniFi controller/Console's admin page either via [unifi.ui.com](https://unifi.ui.com) or via the IP address of your controller

2. On the left navigation bar (that runs the length of the page) click the _people_ icon (`Admin & Users`)

3. Click `+ Create New` at the top of the page and fill it out using the below details

| Field Name                    | Value                                   |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| First name                    | `External`                              |
| Last name                     | `DNS`                                   |
| Admin                         | :white_check_mark:                      |
| Restrict to local access only | :white_check_mark:                      |
| Username                      | `externaldns`                           |
| Password                      | Make up a password, but make note of it |
| Use a pre defined role        | :white_check_mark:                      |
| Role                          | `Super Admin`                           |

Your user should now look like the below

4. Login to your console as the user you have just created. This will need to be done via the controller's IP address

5. **Gear Icon** > **Control Plane** > **Integrations**

Give the API key a name, something like `external-dns`

Copy this Key, we will need it later. Your page should now look like the below

![UniFi Creating API token](md-assets/unifi-subuser-create-api-token.png)

6. Remove elevated permissions from the user

Log back in as your normal account, head over to where we created the External DNS account
(On the left navigation bar (that runs the length of the page) click the _people_ icon (`Admin & Users`))

Open that account, click the **Gear Icon** then match the below

We have unselected **Use a Predefined Role** and changed the _ufo_ icon to `Site admin` and the _person_ to `None`

![Unifi remove excess permissions](md-assets/change-superadmin-account-to-site-admin.png)

You're probably thinking _wow, that was long_, and it's because only super admins can create API tokens, but they do not need
those permissions the entire time to be able to _have_ API token attached to that user. It's a ~bug~ feature in UniFi

The `Site Admin` permissions are more than enough to allow that user to create and manage DNS records in our controller

7. Create a Kubernetes secret called `external-dns-unifi-secret` that will hold your `UNIFI_API_KEY` with their respected values from Step 3.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
    name: external-dns-unifi-secret
stringData:
  api-key: <your-api-key>
```


</details>

<details>
<summary>Username & Password (Deprecated)</summary>
<br>

1. Open your UniFi Console's Network Settings and go to `Settings > Control Plane > Admins & Users`.

2. Select `Create New Admin`.

3. In the menu that appears, enable `Restrict to Local Access Only`. Deselect `Use a Predefined Role`. Set `Network: Site Admin`. All other selections can be set to `None`. Click `Create`.

4. Create a Kubernetes secret called `external-dns-unifi-secret` that holds the `username` and `password` with their respected values from Step 3.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
    name: external-dns-unifi-secret
stringData:
  username: <your-username>
  password: <your-password>
```
</details>

### Installing the provider

1. Add the ExternalDNS Helm repository to your cluster.

    ```sh
    helm repo add external-dns https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/external-dns/
    ```

2. Deploy your `external-dns-unifi-secret` secret that holds your authentication credentials from either of the credential types above.

3. Create the helm values file, for example `external-dns-unifi-values.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    fullnameOverride: external-dns-unifi
    logLevel: &logLevel debug
    provider:
      name: webhook
      webhook:
        image:
          repository: ghcr.io/kashalls/external-dns-unifi-webhook
          tag: main # replace with a versioned release tag
        env:
          - name: UNIFI_HOST
            value: https://192.168.1.1 # replace with the address to your UniFi router/controller
          - name: UNIFI_EXTERNAL_CONTROLLER
            value: "false"
          - name: UNIFI_API_KEY
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: external-dns-unifi-secret
                key: api-key
          - name: LOG_LEVEL
            value: *logLevel
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /healthz
            port: http-webhook
          initialDelaySeconds: 10
          timeoutSeconds: 5
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /readyz
            port: http-webhook
          initialDelaySeconds: 10
          timeoutSeconds: 5
    extraArgs:
      - --ignore-ingress-tls-spec
    policy: sync
    sources: ["ingress", "service"]
    txtOwnerId: default
    txtPrefix: k8s.
    domainFilters: ["example.com"] # replace with your domain
    ```

4. Install the Helm chart

    ```sh
    helm install external-dns-unifi external-dns/external-dns -f external-dns-unifi-values.yaml --version 1.15.0 -n external-dns
    ```
